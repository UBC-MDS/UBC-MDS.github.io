## Installation notes

If you have already installed Git, Latex, or any of the R or Python related packages
please uninstall these and follow the instructions below to reinstall them
(make sure to also remove any user configuration files and backup them if desired).
In order to be able to support you effectively
and minimize setup issues and software conflicts,
we require all students to install the software stack the same way.

In all the sections below,
if you are presented with the choice to download either a 64-bit (also called x64)
or a 32-bit (also called x86) version of the application **always** choose the 64-bit version.

Once you have completed these installation instructions,
make sure to follow the post-installation notes at the end
to check that all software is setup correctly.

## UBC Student Email

Please sign up for a UBC Student Email. This account will also grant you access to a range of UBC services, including Microsoft Teams and OneDrive. To do so navigate to [https://it.ubc.ca/services/email-voice-internet/ubc-student-email-service](https://it.ubc.ca/services/email-voice-internet/ubc-student-email-service) and follow the instructions under "Get Started". 

## Web browser

In MDS we will be using many tools that work most reliably on Google Chrome and Firefox (including our online quiz software), so we recommend that you use one of these browsers.

- Firefox comes preinstalled with Ubuntu, so there is not need to download anything.
- To install Chrome, go to [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/), click on "Download Chrome" choose the deb-file, download it to your computer and click on the downloaded file to install it.

> **Note:** If you select "open with" and try to open the file directly with the Ubuntu Software app instead of downloading it first, the software app might complain that the file is not supported.

## Password manager

A password manager is an efficient and convenient measure to protect your online accounts from most common threats. While you don't strictly need to use one for any of the courses in MDS, we **highly recommend** that you set one up for your own benefit. Examples of reliable password managers include the ones built into Chrome and Firefox, [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), and [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) (if you prefer to sync your passwords manually).

## Slack

For MDS program announcements, course forums, and correspondence we use the communication tool Slack. Slack can be accessed via the web browser, but we recommend using the Slack app, which can be installed via the [Snap store/Ubuntu Software app through this link](https://snapcraft.io/slack) or via the downloadable deb-file from the slack website [https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/linux](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/linux).

## Visual Studio Code

The open-source text editor Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is both a powerful text editor and a full-blown Python IDE, which we will use for more complex analysis. You can install VS Code either via the [Snap store/Ubuntu software app through this link](https://snapcraft.io/code) or via the downloadable deb-file from the VS code website [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). The getting started instructions are here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_deb](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_deb).

You can test that VS code is installed and can be opened from Terminal by restarting terminal and typing the following command:

```
code --version
```

you should see something like this if you were successful:

```
1.59.0
d5e9aa0227e057a60c82568bf31c04730dc15dcd
x64
```

## GitHub

In MDS we will use the publicly available [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) as well as an Enterprise version of GitHub hosted here at UBC, [GitHub.ubc.ca](https://github.ubc.ca). Please follow the set-up instructions for both below.

#### GitHub.com

Sign up for a free account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) if you don't have one already.

#### GitHub.ubc.ca

To add you to the MDS organization on [Github.ubc.ca](https://github.ubc.ca) we need you to login to [Github.ubc.ca](https://github.ubc.ca) using your CWL credentials.

This step is required for

- being able to store your work
- all homework submission and grading
- working collaboratively

## Git

We will be using the command line version of Git as well as Git through RStudio and JupyterLab. Some of the Git commands we will use are only available since Git 2.23, so if your Git is older than this version, we ask you to update it using the following command:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

You can check your git version with the following command:

```
git --version
```

### Configuring Git user info

Next, we need to configure Git by telling it your name and email. To do this type the following into the terminal (replacing Jane Doe and janedoe@example.com, with your name and email (the same you used on GitHub), respectively):

```
git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com
```

> **Note:** To ensure that you haven't made a typo in any of the above, you can view your global Git configurations by either opening the configuration file in a text editor (e.g. via the command `code ~/.gitconfig`) or by typing `git config --list --global`.

### Setting VS Code as the default editor

To make programs run from the terminal (such as `git`) use VS Code by default, we will modify the bash configuration file `~/.bashrc`. First, open it using VS Code:

```
code ~/.bashrc
```

> **Note:** If you see any existing lines in your `~/.bashrc`
> related to a previous Python or R installation,
> please remove these.

Append the following lines:

```
# Set the default editor for programs launch from terminal
EDITOR="code --wait"
VISUAL=$EDITOR  # Use the same value as for "EDITOR" in the line above
```

Then save the file and exit VS Code.

> **Note:** Most terminal programs will read the `EDITOR` environmental variable when determining which editor to use, but some read `VISUAL`, so we're setting both to the same value.

In some cases,
VScode is not set as the default text editor for git
even after appending the two lines above,
so to make sure it is registered properly,
also run the following from your terminal:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

## Python, Conda, and JupyterLab

### Python and Conda

We will be using Python for a large part of the program, and `conda` as our Python package manager. To install Python and the `conda` package manager, we will use the [Miniconda platform (read more here)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), for which the [Python 3.8 64-bit version can be downloaded here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh).

Once the download is finished, open Terminal and execute the following commands:
```
bash path/to/file
```

> **Note:** Most often this file is downloaded to the `Downloads` directory, and thus the command will look like this:
>
>```
>bash Downloads/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
>```

The instructions for the installation will then appear:

1. Press Enter.
2. Once the licence agreement shows, you can press space scroll down, or press `q` to skip reading it.
3. Type `yes` and press enter to accept the licence agreement.
4. Press enter to accept the default installation location.
5. Type `yes` and press enter to instruct the installer to run `conda init`, which makes `conda` available from the terminal/shell.

After installation, restart the terminal. If the installation was successful, you will see `(base)` prepending to your prompt string. To confirm that `conda` is working, you can ask it which version was installed:
```
conda --version
```
which should return something like this:

```
conda 4.10.3
```

Next, type the following to ask for the version of Python:
```
python --version
```
which should return something like this:

```
Python 3.9.5
```

> **Note:** If instead you see `Python 2.7.X` you installed the wrong version. Uninstall the Miniconda you just installed (which usually lives in the `/home/<USER>` directory), and try the installation again, selecting **Python 3.8**.


## Installing Python packages

`conda` installs Python packages from different online repositories which are called "channels".
A package needs to go through thorough testing before it is included in the default channel,
which is good for stability,
but also means that new versions will be delayed and fewer packages are available overall.
There is a community-driven effort called the [conda-forge (read more here)](https://conda-forge.org/),
which provides more up to date packages
To enable us to access the most up to date version of the Python packages we are going to use,
we will add the more up to date  channel,
To add the conda-forge channel by typing the following in the terminal:

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

To install packages individually,
we can now use the following command:
`conda install <package-name>`.
After running that command
`conda` will show you the packages that will be downloaded,
and you can press enter to proceed with the installation.
If you want to answer `yes` by default and skip this confirmation step,
you can replace `conda install` with `conda install -y`.
Let's try this out in the next section,
by installing some of the key packages we will use in MDS.

## JupyterLab setup

We will be using `JupyterLab` as our main coding environment
and `pandas` is one of the key data analyses packages in MDS.
The Jupytext Python package and the JupyterLab git extension facilitates
using notebooks in JupyterLab together with Git & GitHub.
The spellchecker helps us correcting typos in our writing
and the LSP packages fill the same function for our code.
Install them via the following commands:

```bash
conda install pandas jupyterlab jupyterlab-git jupyterlab-spellchecker jupytext jupyterlab-lsp jupyter-lsp-python
```

To test that your JupyterLab installation is functional, you can type `jupyter lab` into a terminal,
which should open a new tab in your default browser with the JupyterLab interface.
To exit out of JupyterLab you can click `File -> Shutdown`,
or go to the terminal from which you launched JupyterLab and hold `Ctrl` while pressing `c` twice.

![](/resources_pages/imgs/jupyter_lab.PNG)

> **Note:** we will use many more packages than those listed above across the MDS program, however we will manage these using virtual environments (which you will learn about in DSCI 521: Platforms for Data Science).

## R, IRkernel, and RStudio

R is another programming language that we will be using a lot in the MDS program. We will use R both in Jupyter notebooks and in RStudio.

#### R

The version of R available in the default Ubuntu repositories is older than the one we use in MDS. To obtain the latest R packages, we need to add a new repository which is maintained directly by the r-project. To do this, first add the key for this repository by typing the following:

```
wget -qO- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cran_ubuntu_key.asc
```

Then add the URL to the repository:

```
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)-cran40/"
```

Next, install `r-base` and `r-base-dev` (useful for compiling R packages from source):

```
sudo apt install r-base r-base-dev
```

After installation, type the following in a new terminal window:
```
R --version
```

You should see something like this if you were successful:

```
R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) -- "Camp Pontanezen"
Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
You are welcome to redistribute it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License versions 2 or 3.
For more information about these matters see
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.
```

> **Note:** [See this page for additoinal instructions if you run into troubles while installing R](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/).

> **Note:** Although it is possible to install R through conda, we highly recommend not doing so. In case you have already installed R using conda you can remove it by executing `conda uninstall r-base`.

### RStudio

Download the Ubuntu 18/Debian 10 Desktop version of RStudio Preview from [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/). Open the file and follow the installer instructions.

> **Note:** There is not yet an official RStudio version for Ubuntu 20.04, so it is recommended to use the Ubuntu 18 version. Also note that if you select "open with" and try to open the file directly with the Ubuntu Software app instead of downloading it first, the software app might complain that the file is not supported.

To see if you were successful, try opening RStudio by clicking on its icon or typing `rstudio` in a terminal. It should open and look something like this picture below:

![](/resources_pages/imgs/RStudio-ubuntu.png)

> **Note:** Since we installed RStudio directly from a deb file rather than from a repository or a snap package, it will not be updated when we run `sudo apt upgrade` and not automatically as for snap packages. Instead, RStudio will notify you of any available updates when the program is launched.

Now we are going to change RStudio’s *Insert Pipe* shortcut so that it inserts the [new native pipe operator `|>`](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/06/09/rstudio-v1-4-update-whats-new/). 
Go to `Tools > Global Options > Code > Editing` and tick the following option:

![](/resources_pages/imgs/new-pipe-rstudio.png)

Once the change is made you can try in the RStudio console `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `m` to check if works.

### Installing R packages

The `tidyverse` R package (and some others) have external dependencies on Ubuntu outside of R. We need to install these first before we install such R packages:

```
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev
```

Next, install the key R packages needed for the start of MDS program,
by opening up RStudio and
typing the following into the R console inside RStudio:

```
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'blogdown', 'xaringan', 'renv', 'usethis', 'devtools', 'languageserver'))
```

> **Note:** We will use many more packages than those listed above across the MDS program, however we will manage these using the `renv` package manager (which you will learn about in DSCI 521: Platforms for Data Science).

### IRkernel

The `IRkernel` package is needed to make R work in Jupyter notebooks. To enable this kernel in the notebooks, install it and run the setup via the following two commands:

```
install.packages('IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec()
```

> **Note:** If you see an error message saying "jupyter-client has to be installed...",
> close RStudio and run the following line from your terminal instead `R -e "IRkernel::installspec()"`.

To see if you were successful, try running JupyterLab and check if you have a working R kernel. To launch JupyterLab, type the following in a terminal:

```
jupyter lab
```

A browser should have launched and you should see a page that looks like the screenshot below. Now click on "R" notebook (circled in red on the screenshot below) to launch an JupyterLab with an R kernel.

![](/resources_pages/imgs/jupyter_lab_r_kernel.png)

Sometimes a kernel loads, but doesn't work as expected. To test whether your installation was done correctly now type `library(tidyverse)` in the code cell and click on the run button to run the cell. If your R kernel works you should see something like the image below:

![](/resources_pages/imgs/jupyter_lab_r_kernel2.png)

To improve the experience of using R in JupyterLab,
we will add keyboard shortcuts for inserting the common R operators `<-` and `|>`.
Go to `Settings -> Advanced Settings Editor -> Keyboard Shortcuts`
and paste the following in the rightmost panel that says `User Preferences`
(replacing the `{}`):

```json
{
    "shortcuts": [
        {
            "command": "apputils:run-first-enabled",
            "selector": "body",
            "keys": ["Alt -"],
            "args": {
                "commands": [
                    "console:replace-selection",
                    "fileeditor:replace-selection",
                    "notebook:replace-selection",
                ],
                "args": {"text": "<- "}
            }
        },
        {
            "command": "apputils:run-first-enabled",
            "selector": "body",
            "keys": ["Accel Shift M"],
            "args": {
                "commands": [
                    "console:replace-selection",
                    "fileeditor:replace-selection",
                    "notebook:replace-selection",
                ],
                "args": {"text": "|> "}
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

After you have pasted this text,
hit the small floppy disk in the top right (or `Ctrl` + `s`)
to save the settings.
Here is a screenshot of what it looks like with the settings saved:

![](/resources_pages/imgs/r-jl-text-shortcuts.png)

To check that the extension is working,
open JupyterLab,
launch an R notebook,
and try inserting the operators by pressing `Alt` + `-` or `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `m`, respectively.
You could add any arbitrary text insertion command the same way,
but this is all that is required for MDS.

## LaTeX

We will install the lightest possible version of LaTeX and it's necessary packages as possible so that we can render Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown documents to html and PDF. If you have previously installed LaTeX, please uninstall it before proceeding with these instructions.

First, open RStudio and run the following commands to install the `tinytex` package and setup `tinytex`:

```
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

The above is all we need to have LaTeX work with R Markdown documents, however for Jupyter we need to add the TinyTex executables to our `PATH` and install several more packages (`PATH` is a collection of directories which contain the available executable programs on your computer).

To append the TinyTex executables to our `PATH` we need to edit our `.bashrc` file. The TinyTex executables are usually installed in `~/bin`. Thus, add the lines below to the bottom of your `.bashrc` file (which you can open by `code ~/.bashrc`) and save the file:

```
# Append TinyTex executables to the path
export PATH="$PATH:~/bin"
```

When you launch a new terminal instance, this directory will have been added to your path
(you can check this by running `echo $PATH` in the terminal).
Now you can check that the latex installation is working
by opening a terminal and asking for the version of latex:

```
latex --version
```

You should see something like this if you were successful:

```
pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020)
kpathsea version 6.3.2
Copyright 2020 Han The Thanh (pdfTeX) et al.
There is NO warranty.  Redistribution of this software is
covered by the terms of both the pdfTeX copyright and
the Lesser GNU General Public License.
For more information about these matters, see the file
named COPYING and the pdfTeX source.
Primary author of pdfTeX: Han The Thanh (pdfTeX) et al.
Compiled with libpng 1.6.37; using libpng 1.6.37
Compiled with zlib 1.2.11; using zlib 1.2.11
Compiled with xpdf version 4.02
```

Next, install the additional LaTeX packages needed for Jupyter
by pasting the following into the new terminal instance and press enter:

```
tlmgr install eurosym \
  adjustbox \
  caption \
  collectbox \
  enumitem \
  environ \
  fp \
  jknapltx \
  ms \
  parskip \
  pgf \
  rsfs \
  tcolorbox \
  titling \
  trimspaces \
  ucs \
  ulem \
  upquote \
  lwarp \
  oberdiek
```

To test that your latex installation is working with jupyter notebooks,
launch `jupyter lab` from the terminal where you confirmed that latex works
and open either a new notebook
or the same one you used to test IRkernel above.
Go to `File -> Export notebook as... -> Export Notebook to PDF`.
If the PDF file is created,
your LaTeX environment is set up correctly.

### WebPDF export

Jupyter recently added another way to export notebooks to PDF
which does not require Latex
and makes the exported PDF look similar to notebooks exported to HTML.
This requires the `pyppeteer` package,
which we can install as follows.

```bash
conda install pyppeteer=0.2.2
pyppeteer-install
```

Try this by going to `File -> Export notebook as... -> Export Notebook to WebPDF`.

## PostgreSQL

We will be using PostgreSQL as our database management system.
The Ubuntu repositories contain PostgreSQL 12,
in MDS we will be using PostgreSQL 13,
so you need to follow the instructions in the PostgreSQL documentation
to [first add the their repository
and then install the latest version](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/).

By default, this installation creates a new user called `postgres`,
which is the only one with permission to open the databases.
We will see how to set this up for other users later in the program,
but for now run the following to confirm that your installation was successful:

```
sudo su -c psql postgres
```

The above should yield the prompt to change to what is shown below:

```
psql (13.3 (Ubuntu 13.3-1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

> **Note:** To exit from Postgres type `exit`, or press `ctrl` + `d`.

## Docker

You will use Docker to create reproducible, sharable and shippable computing environments for your analyses. For this you will need a Docker account. You can [sign up for a free one here](https://store.docker.com/signup?next=%2F%3Fref%3Dlogin).

After signing-up, you also need to install Docker **CE** for Ubuntu. Install the stable version by following the installation instructions using the ["Install using the repository" methods found here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository), including the subheadings "Set up the repository" and "Install Docker engine" (you can skip step 2 "Install a specific version of the docker engine" since we already got the latest from step 1).

Next, [follow the Linux post installation steps here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) so that you can run Docker without typing `sudo`
(only the subheading "Managing docker as a non-root user").
Confirm that docker is working by following the verification instructions on that same page.

## VS Code extensions

The real magic of VS Code is in the extensions that let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your specific workflow. From within VS Code you can open up the [Extension Marketplace (read more here)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) to browse and install extensions by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar indicated in the figure below.

![](/resources_pages/imgs/vscode.png)

To install an extension, you simply search for it in the search bar, click the extension you want, and then click "Install". There are extensions available to make almost any workflow or task you are interested in more efficient! Here we are interested in setting up VS Code as a Python IDE. To do this, search for and install the following extensions:

- Python (everything Python: notebooks, debugging, linting, formatting, etc.)
- markdownlint (markdown linting and style checking extension)
- GitLens (powerful extension that extends VS Code's native git capabilities)
- Git History (intutive view of your git history)
- Docker (easily use Docker from VS Code)
- (Optional) Material Theme and/or Predawn Theme Kit (additional colour themes to choose from)
- (Optional) Material Icon Theme (great-looking custom file icons!)
- (Optional) Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 (add colour to help distinguish your brackets: (), [], {})

[This video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06I63_p-2A4) is an excellent introduction to using VS Code in Python.

## Improving the bash configuration

To improve your experience using bash,
we recommend appending a few lines to the end of your bash configuration file.
These make it easier to use the TAB key for autocompletion
improves how bash handles the command history,
and the appearance of the terminal
(we will talk more about these topics during class).
It also adds colors to the terminal's text,
which can make it easier to navigate visually.
First,
run the following command to download a script
that always shows information about git in the terminal prompt:

```bash
curl -Sso ~/.git-prompt.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh
```

Then open the bash configuration file:

```bash
code ~/.bash_profile
```

Paste the following at the end of the file
(make sure not to overwrite any existing lines)
and save it afterwards:

```bash
# Load the git prompt script
source ~/.git-prompt.sh
# Show unstaged (*) and staged (+) changes in the prompt string
export GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1

# Color the prompt string and add git info
export PS1=${CONDA_PROMPT_MODIFIER}'\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[01;34m\] \w\[\033[33m\]$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")\[\033[00m\]\n\$ '

# TAB completion configuration
# TAB completion ignores case
bind "set completion-ignore-case on"
# Require only one instead of two TAB presses before showing matches
bind "set show-all-if-ambiguous on"
# If there are multiple matches for completion, cycle through them with TAB
bind 'TAB':menu-complete
# Perform partial completion on the first Tab press,
# only start cycling full results on the second Tab press
bind "set menu-complete-display-prefix on"

# History configuration
# Cycle through history based on characters already typed on the line
bind '"\e[A":history-search-backward'
bind '"\e[B":history-search-forward'
# Append to the history file, don't overwrite it.
shopt -s histappend
# Write commands to history one-by-one right after they are executed
# instead of all together when the terminal is closed.
# Make new terminals see all commands run in currently open terminals and
# prepend a newline to the prompt string to separate it from the last command's output
PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a; echo'
# Increase history size
HISTSIZE=50000
HISTFILESIZE=50000

# Aliases and functions
# Note that aliases only are in effect when you are using the shell interactively
# (e.g. opening the terminal and typing or pasting commands).
# If you run a bash script or makefile,
# the original command is used instead of your alias.
# More verbose file list format
alias l='ls -vlrthAF'
# Move, remove, and copy show what was done and prompt before overwriting files.
alias rm="rm -vI"
alias mv="mv -vi"
alias cp="cp -vi"
alias mkdir="mkdir -vp"
```

## Post-installation notes

You have completed the installation instructions, well done 🙌!
We have created a script to help you check that your installation was successful,
and to provide instructions for how you can troubleshoot any issues.
To run this script,
please execute the following command from your terminal.

```
bash <(curl -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-MDS/UBC-MDS.github.io/master/resources_pages/check-setup-mds.sh)
```

The output from running the script will look something like this:

````
# MDS setup check 1.1.0

If a program or package is marked as MISSING,
this means that you are missing the required version of that program or package.
Either it is not installed at all or the wrong version is installed.
The required version is indicated with a number and an asterisk (*),
e.g. 4.* means that all versions starting with 4 are accepted (4.0.1, 4.2.5, etc).

You can run the following commands to find out which version
of a program or package is installed (if any):
```
name_of_program --version  # For system programs
conda list  # For Python packages
R -q -e "installed.packages()[,c(Package, Version)]"  # For R packages
```

As you can see at the end of the output,
a log file is saved in your current directory.
We might ask you to upload this file
if we need to troubleshoot your installation,
so that we can help you more effectively.
If any of your packages are marked as "MISSING"
you will need to figure out what is wrong and possibly reinstall them.
Once all packages are marked as "OK"
we will ask you to submit this log file,
so that we can confirm that your installation was successful.
Details on where to submit will be provided later.

> **Note:** In general you should be careful running scripts unless they come from a trusted source as in this case (just like how you should be careful when downloading and installing programs on your computer).
