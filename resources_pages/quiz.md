### Overview

With the exception of [project courses](https://ubc-mds.github.io/2019-08-22-project-courses/), MDS courses will have two quizzes throughout the block, typically one in the middle of the course and another after the course ends during the free days between blocks. The quizzes for a course will appear on the [MDS calendar](https://ubc-mds.github.io/calendar/) (ideally before the course starts) so that students are aware of the timing. We anticipate most quizzes being 45 minutes long.

### Purpose

The purpose of quizzes are to be a "sanity check" that students are keeping up with the essential material. While labs may go more in-depth into a topic, the quizzes cover essential material that we expect students to have mastered and to retain.

### Difficulty

In light of the purpose above, quizzes are intended to be less difficult than the labs. They are not meant to trick you nor to contain unexpected material. In short, if you did the labs without an unreasonable amount of collaboration with your classmates, you should succeed on the quizzes.

### Quiz Format and Platform

This year, quizzes will be held on PrairieLearn. Instead of quizzes being held at the same time for every student, we will provide quiz windows (available time slots) for students to register for their preferred time. Quizzes will feature randomized questions, so each student may receive a slightly different version of the quiz.

### Digital Cheatsheets

Students are now allowed to use digital cheatsheets, which can be uploaded to the PrairieLearn system. This means students can prepare a digital double-sided A4 cheatsheet and submit it directly within the PrairieLearn interface before starting their quiz.

### PrairieTest

You must complete the instruction below before writing quizzes. This is an essential step to check in the quiz room.
- Open https://ca.prairietest.com/pt
- Click Login and select University of British Columbia (ubc.ca)
- Log in with your CWL
- Accept the invitation to join MDS 5XX
  - You only need to do this once, and please DM the course coordinator if you have issues viewing the invitation.
- You will see a list of future quizzes, including quiz times and locations, under Exam reservations.

### Quiz Logistics

- You must register for a specific quiz time slot using PrairieTest. This will typically occur the week before quizzes.
- All MDS quizzes are closed-book and closed-internet, with the exception of a digital cheatsheet.
- Communication with anyone or any external resources during the quiz is strictly prohibited. For details, please visit our [Quiz policies](https://ubc-mds.github.io/policies/#quiz-policies) and [Plagiarism](https://ubc-mds.github.io/policies/#plagiarism) pages.
- You must attend your assigned quiz time and location. Failure to check in at the correct time and location may result in missing the quiz.
- When instructed to leave the room after the quiz, please do so quietly to avoid disrupting others. Refrain from discussing the - quiz with anyone until everyone has completed it.

### Quiz Room Procedures

#### Upon arriving at the quiz room

1. Attend the assigned quiz session in your designated quiz room (check [PrairieTest](https://ca.prairietest.com/pt) if you are unsure).
2. Be present at least **10 minutes** before the quiz starts.
3. Upon entering the exam room, do **not** communicate with anyone other than the invigilators.
4. An invigilator will check you in. Wait until the reader displays a **red** light before tapping your student card.
5. Place all personal belongings and electronics on the racks at the front of the room (phones, bags, hats, jackets, smartwatches, etc.). Phones must be turned off or on airplane mode.
  - Exceptions: You are allowed to upload a digital double-sided A4 cheatsheet. Scrap papers will be provided by the exam room.
  - Exceptions: You may bring a scientific calculator if you wish, but an embedded calculator is available.
6. Find a seat and log into the provided computer using the username and password displayed on the whiteboard or wall.
7. Use **Mircrosoft Edge** to open **canvas.ubc.ca**
8. Log in with your CWL. If you need Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), raise your hand and inform the invigilator.
9. Navigate to the quiz page, and wait for further instructions.
  - Ensure you open the correct quiz for your lab section.

#### During the Quiz

1. Once the invigilator announces the quiz password, you may begin.
3. You have 45 minutes to answer all questions. An embedded countdown timer will show the remaining time, and the quiz will auto-submit when the timer runs out.
4. If you finish early, wait quietly. The TA or lab instructor will specify when the quiz period is over.
5. After the exam ends, **close the browser** and hand in your digital cheatsheet and any scrap papers as you exit the room.
  - If another quiz session follows yours, leave the building quietly to avoid disturbances.

### Closed-book Policy

Unless otherwise specified, **quizzes will be closed-book** except for the digital double-sided A4 cheatsheet. This means that during the quiz, students are expected to:

  - **Not** use the internet to solve quiz questions.
  - **Not** bring any materials that would assist in completing the quiz (aside from the digital cheatsheet).
  - **Not** open any other files or webpages apart from the PrairieLearn quiz.
  - **Not** leave the quiz room early or re-enter after leaving (except for necessary reasons like using the washroom).

### No Collaboration

You may **not** communicate with other students or anyone else through any medium during the quiz. Communication with classmates is prohibited until all students have finished the quiz. There will be multiple quiz sessions, so please avoid discussing the quiz on Slack or elsewhere until at least 30 minutes after the end of the final quiz session.

### Things to Bring/Remember

- **Student card**: Required for check-in and accessing the ICCS building after hours (after 5 pm).
- **Digital Cheatsheet**: Upload your digital double-sided A4 cheatsheet to PrairieLearn before the quiz.
- **CWL password**: Memorize your password for logging into PrairieLearn.

### Special Circumstances

1. **I finished the quiz early:**

  - Wait quietly at your seat until the quiz period ends.
  
2. **I need to use the washroom:**

  - Raise your hand and notify the invigilator. Leave only if permitted. We recommend using the washroom before the quiz starts.
