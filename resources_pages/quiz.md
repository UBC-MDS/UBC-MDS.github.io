### Overview

With the exception of [project courses](https://ubc-mds.github.io/2019-08-22-project-courses/), MDS courses will have two quizzes throughout the block, typically one in the middle of the course and another after the course ends during the free days between blocks. The quizzes for a course will appear on the [MDS calendar](https://ubc-mds.github.io/calendar/) (ideally before the course starts) so that students are aware of the timing. We anticipate most quizzes being 50 minutes long.

### Purpose

The purpose of quizzes are to be a "sanity check" that students are keeping up with the essential material. While labs may go more in-depth into a topic, the quizzes cover essential material that we expect students to have mastered and to retain.

### Difficulty

In light of the purpose above, quizzes are intended to be less difficult than the labs. They are not meant to trick you nor to contain unexpected material. In short, if you did the labs without an unreasonable amount of collaboration with your classmates, you should succeed on the quizzes.

### Quiz Format and Platform

This year, quizzes will be held on PrairieLearn. Instead of quizzes being held at the same time for every student, we will provide quiz windows (available time slots) for students to register for their preferred time. Quizzes will feature randomized questions, so each student may receive a slightly different version of the quiz.

During the quiz window, students are **NOT** allowed to disclose, discuss, or share any part of the quiz with any other individual, except as directly permitted or required by the course instructors. This includes discussions in person, online, or through any electronic means. Violation of this policy will result in academic penalties, which may include failure of the quiz or failure of the course.

### Digital Cheatsheets

Students are now allowed to use digital cheatsheets, which can be uploaded to the PrairieLearn system. The cheatsheet must be:
- **handwritten** on a **single-sided**, **one-page**, **letter-sized** sheet (8.5x11 inches).
- The cheatsheet must then be scanned and uploaded as a PDF **before** the quiz.
- The cheatsheet file has to be named as `cheatsheet.pdf`.
- You may create your cheatsheet on an iPad, but it must be handwritten using a stylus—**no typing is allowed**.
  - Students with accommodations from CfA for handwriting may be granted exceptions.
- Sharing of cheatsheets is strictly prohibited.
- TAs will verify that your cheatsheet complies with these instructions. No prior approval will be given, but cheatsheets that do not meet the requirements may be removed.

#### Instructions to Upload Cheatsheet

**Note**: Please use **Chrome** or **Firefox** to upload your cheatsheet. Other browsers may not work. If you haven’t installed these browsers, please refer to the [installation guide](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/installation_instructions/) for instructions.

1. Log in to PrairieLearn and navigate to the course where you need to upload your cheatsheet.
2. Select the "Cheatsheet" assessment and open the corresponding upload question.
3. Upload your cheatsheet, ensuring it meets the cheatsheet [requirements](#digital-cheatsheets).
4. Click `Save & Grade` to submit your file.
5. Once uploaded, you should see a preview of your PDF on PrairieLearn. You can update and re-upload your cheatsheet as many times as needed before the deadline.
