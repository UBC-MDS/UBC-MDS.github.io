### Overview
With the exception of [project courses](https://ubc-mds.github.io/2019-08-22-project-courses/), MDS courses will have two quizzes throughout the block, typically one in the middle of the course and another after the course ends during the free days between blocks. The quizzes for a course will appear on the [MDS calendar](https://ubc-mds.github.io/calendar/) (ideally before the course starts) so that students are aware of the timing. We anticipate most quizzes being 45 minutes long.

### Purpose
The purpose of quizzes are to be a "sanity check" that students are keeping up with the essential material. While labs may go more in-depth into a topic, the quizzes cover essential material that we expect students to have mastered and to retain.

### Difficulty
In light of the purpose above, quizzes are intended to be less difficult than the labs. They are not meant to trick you nor to contain unexpected material. In short, if you did the labs without an unreasonable amount of collaboration with your classmates, you should succeed on the quizzes.

### Format

Quizzes will typically be through [Canvas](canvas.ubc.ca). Unlike labs, quizzes will be performed within a defined time period and will be supervised by MDS instructional staff.

Upon arriving at the quiz room:

1. You must attend the assigned quiz session in your designed quiz room (check [PraireTest](https://ca.prairietest.com/pt) if you are unsure).
2. You must be present 10 minutes before the quiz starts.
3. Tap your student card to check in the quiz room.

At the start of the quiz period:

1. Go to <https://canvas.ubc.ca>, and log in with your CWL.
2. Navigate to the relevant quiz on the relevant course page.
3. Begin the quiz after being instructed to, fill out your answers, and click "submit". You will have a countdown timer to complete the quiz.
4. Wait quietly until the quiz time slot finishes. The TA or lab instructor will specify when the quiz period is finished.
5. If you are the first section to write the quiz, leave the room quietly and refrain from discussing the quiz with anyone else.


## Timing

When we set up a quiz on Canvas, we specify a start time, end time, and duration. For example, if a quiz is at 9:00am, we might set the start time to 9:00am, the end time to 9:50, and the duration to 45 min. That means you have 45 min to complete the quiz within the 50-minute window from 9:00 to 9:50. Individual instructors may vary this slightly but the window will generally be at least 2 minutes longer than the quiz duration itself. In general, we recommend you start the quiz within 2 minutes of the quiz period starting, so that you have the full length of time to write your quiz.

_2020-2021 changes:_ Quizzes will generally be 40 minutes within a 45-minute window.


### Closed-book

Unless otherwise specified, **quizzes will be closed-book** except for a double-sided A4 cheatsheet. This means that during the quiz students are expected to:

  - **not** use the internet to solve questions on the quiz
  - **not** bring any materials into the quiz that would be of assistance in completing the quiz (aside from a cheatsheet)
  - **not** open other files or webpages other than the Canvas quiz
  - **not** leave the quiz room early, and not come back into the quiz room after leaving (other than for purposes such as using the washroom)


### No collaboration

You may **not** communicate with other students or anyone else or any robots, through any medium, at any time during the quiz. You may not communicate with any of your classmates until everyone is finished the quiz. For each quiz, there will be two sessions. Please don't post about MDS quizzes on Slack until at least 30 minutes after the end of the **second** quiz, in case some students were given extra time.


### General Guidelines

There is rarely a need to write more than two brief sentences for any given question. 

### Special Circumstances

#### I cannot submit the quiz!

Take screen shots of your completed quiz, and send them through Slack to the lab instructor of the course before the end of the quiz period.

#### I'm finished the quiz early

Wait quietly on your seat until the end of the quiz period.

#### I need to use the washroom

Raise your hand and notify the invigilator. Leave only if you are permitted to. However, we recommend that you use the washroom before the quiz.

### Instructions for TAs

1. Go to the quiz room **at least 10 minutes** before the quiz time to check students in.
2. Announce the Canvas password to start students off.
3. Try to walk around and make sure that at least one of the TAs stays at the back of the classroom.
4. Report to us if you observe any form of academic dishonesty or chatting in the classroom.
5. Ask the students to stay in the room for the full time even after they are done. (If students start leaving the room it can be distracting for other students.)
6. If you encounter issues during the quiz, inform the lab instructor or the course coordinator through Slack.
