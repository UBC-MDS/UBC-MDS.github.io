# Help messages
help_preamble="
This help message shows a brief explanation
of the most important terminal commands we use in MDS.
It is meant to be complement the lecture notes
and be used as a reference when you forget a command.
Note that the words 'directory' and 'folder' are used interchangeably.
This also includes the aliases we have created in your bash configuration files
for commands that are very useful and that we want encourage you to use often.

All the commands are printed by default,
but you can specifiy a single section to show
by using the subcommands 'shell', 'git', 'conda', or 'alias'.
For example, if you only want to see the shell command help you would type:

mds-help shell
