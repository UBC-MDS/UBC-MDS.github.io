title: Learning Resources
subtitle: Optional extra preparation for entering UBC MDS students
---

The following is a list of online resources that might be useful preparation for the UBC MDS program. Completion of these courses
does not replace the [official program prerequisites](http://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/admissions). Rather, this page is
mainly intended for entering students who may wish to reinforce their preparation before the program starts.
Many of these resources can also be helpful resources during the program. Highly recommended items are in bold.

Disclaimer: We have not vetted all these resources ourselves, but rather selected them based on a combination of our experience, recommendation from colleagues, and the resources descriptions.
If you have feedback about them, please [let us know](http://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/contact-us).
