## What is CfA?

The CfA stands for the Centre for Accessibility. It provides disability-related accommodations and programming designed to remove barriers for students with disabilities or ongoing medical conditions in all aspects of university life. For more information, visit the [Centre for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility).

In the MDS program, if you have a disability or ongoing medical condition, you can request quiz accommodations through the CfA.

## Accommodations

If you have an accommodation letter from the Center for Accessibility (CfA), please send it to the course coordinators to ensure that your approved accommodations are provided throughout the program.

If **all** of your accommodations **can** be met by the CBTF (check the list [here](https://cbtf.ubc.ca/students/accommodations)), you will continue to write your quizzes at the CBTF. Please follow the instructions on the [MDS quizzes](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/) page to register for your quizzes.

For accommodations that cannot be provided by the CBTF, follow the instructions below. You should still go through the [MDS quiz policies](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/). Just note that the following sections will not apply to you:
- [PrairieTest and Making a Reservation for your Quiz](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/#prairietest-and-making-a-reservation-for-your-quiz)
- [Quiz Room Procedures](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/#quiz-room-procedures)

## CfA Quiz Booking

You do **not** need to make a reservation on [PrairieTest](https://us.prairietest.com/pt). Instead, we will assign you to a special session to write your quiz outside of the CBTF.
- Book each of your quizzes through the CfA following their instructions [here](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility).
    - You can choose your quiz times as long as they fall within the quiz window specified in the calendar **and** do not overlap with your lecture or lab times.
- Please also book the quizzes early, as the CfA requires us to provide them with exam instructions at least three business days before the quiz date.


## CfA Quiz instructions

- You should go to the location specified by the CfA at your booked times.
- You need to take your laptop with you, and ensure it has enough power (or bring a charger).
- To start the quiz, open PrairieTest and click on your exam reservation.
- There will be three links: 2 quiz links (both point to the same quiz, so click on either of the link works), and a cheatsheet link.
- An invigilator will be with you to give you the password to start the quiz.
- If you have any access issues or timer issues (such as not receiving 1.5 exam time) during the quiz, ask the invigilator to contact one of the course coordinators to help you.

## Quiz Review Sessions
