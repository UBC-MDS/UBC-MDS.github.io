## Accommodations

If you have an accommodation letter from the Center for Accessibility, please send them to the course coordinators to ensure you receive your approved accommodations throughout the program.

If **all** of your accommodations **can** be accommodated by the CBTF (check the list [here](https://cbtf.ubc.ca/students/accommodations)), you will still write your quizzes at the CBTF. Please follow instructions on [MDS quizzes](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/).

Otherwise, please follow the instructions below.

## List of MDS Quiz instructions that diverge

You should still go through the [MDS quizzes](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/) page. The only sections that do not apply to you is:
- [PrairieTest and Making a Reservation for your Quiz](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/#prairietest-and-making-a-reservation-for-your-quiz)
- [Quiz Room Procedures](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/#quiz-room-procedures)


## CfA Quiz Booking

- On [PrairieTest](https://us.prairietest.com/pt), you do **not** need to make a reservation. Instead, we will assign you to a special session allowing you to write your quiz outside of the CBTF.
- You should book each of your quizzes with the CfA. Instructions are provided by [the CfA](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility).
    - You can pick your own quiz times, as long as they fall in the quiz window specified in the calendar, **and** they cannot happen during your lecture and lab times.
- Please also book the quizzes early, as the CfA requires us to provide them with exam instructions at least three business days before the quiz date.


## CfA Quiz instructions

- You should go to the location specified by the CfA at your booked times.
- You need to take your laptop with you, and ensure it has enough power (or bring a charger).
- To start the quiz, open PrairieTest and click on your exam reservation.
- There will be three links: 2 quiz links (both point to the same quiz, so click on either of the link works), and a cheatsheet link.
- An invigilator will be with you to give you the password to start the quiz.
- If you have any access issues or timer issues (such as not receiving 1.5 exam time) during the quiz, ask the invigilator to contact one of the course coordinators to help you.

## Quiz Review Sessions

Please follow the quiz review instructions on [MDS quizzes](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/#quiz-results-review-session).
