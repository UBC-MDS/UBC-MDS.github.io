Courses in the UBC Master of Data Science - Vancouver program are primarily taught by our core teaching team. The team is in constant communication to share ideas, support each other, and collaboratively build the best program we can. These are the faces that you will be seeing every day throughout the MDS program.

## Team Stats

- **13** : The total number of different languages we speak (including Cantonese, Farsi, Hindi, Japanese, Malayalam, Mandarin, Marathi, Nepali, Spanish, Swedish, and Vietnamese)
- **20** : The total number of coding languages we have experience working with as a whole.
- **10** : The number of different countries our team cheers for during the Olympics.
- **5.7** : The average number of years our team has of teaching experience (with a standard deviation of 3.2).
- **10** : The median number of postsecondary education years our team has studied.

## Team Facts

- The team often uses <a href="https://www.bitmoji.com/" target="_blank">Bitmojis</a> to communicate with one another.
- The team is an assortment of morning birds (early risers) and night owls (late sleepers).
- We have a teamwork contract that promotes a respectful and transparent work environment.
- We hold weekly team meetings where we discuss not only our work progress but also our social wellbeing (this was implemented during COVID when we were working from home and we decided to keep it).
