**_The call for MDS-V Capstone project proposals will be open late summer or early fall._**

During the last two months of the Master of Data Science program (May & June each year), our students work in teams of ~4 students with an external capstone partner and a UBC mentor to address a question facing the capstone partner's organization using data science. The capstone program is free for partner organizations to participate in, but requires a point person who is willing to meet regularly with the students and offer guidance.
