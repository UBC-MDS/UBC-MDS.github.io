**Capstone Project Proposals open in fall each year, [see the timeline for this year's submission deadlines](/capstone/timeline).**

Partners may choose to submit a capstone project(s) to the [MDS Vancouver](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/) program (general data science) and/or the [MDS Computational Linguistics](https://ubc-mdscl.github.io/program/aboutme/) program (language-related data science). If you're unsure about which program to submit your project to, read more below.

Proposal forms can be found here:
- [MDS Vancouver proposal form](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cDgsSg3eb9zPcZo).
- [MDS Computational Linguistics proposal form](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0VdmnKK7058Gy6W).
- [An example proposal](/capstone/sample_proposal).


### Should I submit my proposal to MDS Vancouver or MDS Computational Linguistics?

The MDS Vancouver (MDS-V) program covers all aspects of data science, including topics of data wrangling, visualisation, dashboards,  statistics and machine learning, amongst others. You can read more about the program [here](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/vancouver) and can see the [capstone page](/capstone/about) on this website to learn more about the type of projects MDS-V addresses in capstone.

The MDS Computational Linguistics (MDS-CL) program covers similar topics to MDS Vancouver but with a focus on analyzing language/text-related data and building models that can extract insights from this data. Particular areas of expertise include deep learning, sentiment analysis, and multi-lingual methods such as machine translation. You can read more about the program [here](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/computational-linguistics) and can see the [MDS-CL capstone page](https://ubc-mdscl.github.io/capstone/past_projects/) to learn more about the type of projects MDS-CL addresses in capstone.

## Instructions for filling out the capstone proposal form

The proposal form will ask you to fill out general information about your organization
and information specific to the project your are proposing.
We are specifically interesting in understanding the problem/question
that students will be working on,
details about what the data for the project looks like,
and what data product the students are expected to deliver at the end of the project.

You can find more details about the required information in this year's proposal form,
linked above.
If the proposal form is not open yet,
you can view this PDF with the questions that were asked in a previous year.
<!--TODO print qualtrics form to PDF once we have finalized it and insert link here. Also insert CL link separately? -->

**NOTE** If your project requires confidentiality and IP assignment, please read our [legal page](https://ubc-mds.github.io/capstone/guide-to-mutual-nda-ip/) on how we handle these before submitting your capstone proposal. **_For non-UBC Capstone partners whose projects require confidentiality and IP assignment, we strongly recommend that partners show the UBC template documents to their legal counsel and get their agreement to use these documents before submitting the capstone proposal. We cannot sign alternate agreements, nor amend our agreements in any way._**
